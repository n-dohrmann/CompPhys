=============================================

**Noah Dohrmann**

This is a collection of assignments from a course in computational physics
using Fortran90. A below is an outline of topics covered. 

1. Random number generation and sequence quality.

2. John Conway's *Game of Life*. Cellular automata and emergent behavior.

3. Artificial Neural Networks: Implementing a small perceptron.

4. Intro to Monte Carlo: Calculation of Pi using randomly generated
   coordinates.

5. Optimal Moderator Thickness in a Nuclear Reactor. Simulating neutron
   backscattering and thermalization.

6. Finite Element Analysis and stability conditions. Simulating heat flow with COMSOL.
